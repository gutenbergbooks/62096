  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Now, Dougal MacNeer was a pioneer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Just one of a million such</div>
    <div class="verse">Who labor and toil in unmapped soil</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With shovel and pick and hutch.</div>
    <div class="verse">He was six-foot-two, and a man whom few</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Would care to engage in a fight,</div>
    <div class="verse">With shoulders as firm as a pachyderm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A tower of granite might.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">He had eyes of gray, and a quiet way</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of minding his own affairs;</div>
    <div class="verse">He never came down to a commerce town</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Save for fueling or ship repairs.</div>
    <div class="verse">Thus it was that he roused the <i>whys?</i> and <i>hows?</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the minds of the spaceport clique</div>
    <div class="verse">When he landed at Krull<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with his tanks half full</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And rented a berth for a week.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">The cradle-monk<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> stared, then boldly dared,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"By golly, you've struck it rich!</div>
    <div class="verse">I always knew some day you'd come through,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You lucky son-of-a&mdash;&mdash;"</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">"Which,"</div>
    <div class="verse">Asked Doug MacNeer with a smile sincere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"Is the best joy-joint in Krull?</div>
    <div class="verse">I've lived alone till my mind's ingrown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">This prospecting life is dull.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"I want to go play from the dusk of day</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Till I waken to morning bells."</div>
    <div class="verse">The attendant said, with a nod of the head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"You amble to Venus Nell's.</div>
    <div class="verse">It's the hottest place in this end of space,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Just a couple of minutes' jaunt;</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell's got music and games, and likker and dames</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;And anything else you want!"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"Thanks, that sounds great!" said Mac. But, "Wait!"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Begged the other, "Gimme a break!</div>
    <div class="verse">Help me out of this rut, MacNeer, and cut</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Me in on a share of the take?"</div>
    <div class="verse">"The take?" asked Doug with a little shrug,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"But <i>I</i> haven't made any find!"</div>
    <div class="verse">And he strolled away with a whistle gay</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While the monkey glowered behind.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">In a moment or two, Doug wandered through</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The gaudily-neoned door</div>
    <div class="verse">Of a feverish-gay, bright cabaret;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Below, on the mirrored floor</div>
    <div class="verse">Of the dancehall swayed a cavalcade</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of every breed and race</div>
    <div class="verse">Whose daughters and sons defy the suns</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To journey the ways of space.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">A miner from Mars, pockmarked with scars</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Pressed close to a woman from Io,</div>
    <div class="verse">A Jovian baby drawled lazily, "Maybe&mdash;"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To pleas of a tar from Ohio;</div>
    <div class="verse">A vicious-mouthed slattern from faraway Saturn</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sang ditties to make the hair curl.</div>
    <div class="verse">And then&mdash;curtains parted, and Doug MacNeer started</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To see such a beautiful girl!</div>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Venus Nell was no saint, any preacher would paint</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A bad ending for her at a peek.</div>
    <div class="verse">But her worst enemy would be forced to agree</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">There was nothing wrong with her physique.</div>
    <div class="verse">She was flat where it flattered, and curved where it mattered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A creature of streamline and bubbles;</div>
    <div class="verse">She had bright yaller hair, and a definite flair</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For taking men's minds off their troubles.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">She never had known the cap or the gown</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of grammar- or high-school or college,</div>
    <div class="verse">Which didn't mean she couldn't win her A.B.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In a certain and specialized knowledge.</div>
    <div class="verse">She had lure and illusion; creating confusion</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">'Mongst men was but one of her tricks.</div>
    <div class="verse">Doug's eyes opened wide when she strolled to his side</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;And he fell like a cargo of bricks!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">She drawled, "Howdy, sailor!" and Dougal turned paler,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"H-howdy!" he managed to answer.</div>
    <div class="verse">Then, in sudden alarm, "Are you one of the charm-</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Gals?" he questioned, "Or only a dancer?"</div>
    <div class="verse">Now, why an admission of her true position</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nell should at that moment decide</div>
    <div class="verse">To conceal is a mystery buried in history;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whatever the reason, she lied.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">In fashion designed to make any man blind</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She lowered her lashes and blushed.</div>
    <div class="verse">(Which was no mean achievement itself.) "Oh, believe</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Me! I'm no&mdash;entertainer," she gushed.</div>
    <div class="verse">"I sell cigarettes, and I sometimes take bets</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">On the rocketship races&mdash;" MacNeer</div>
    <div class="verse">Slowly nodded his head as he quietly said</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"A girl like you shouldn't be here!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"I think we'd do well to get out of this hell</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of evil and vice," he decided.</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell had to sit still and bite her lips till</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her inner amusement subsided.</div>
    <div class="verse">This curious sucker, it suddenly struck her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Meant business! His motives were pure.</div>
    <div class="verse">To lead on the calf should be good for a laugh ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She smiled at him, shy and demure.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"Oh, I cannot do that," she replied, "but a chat</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In a quieter spot&mdash;?" And she led</div>
    <div class="verse">Dougal out of the blare to a cool garden square</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With the stars burning high overhead.</div>
    <div class="verse">She gave orders by sign that a beaker of wine</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Be served in their shady retreat,</div>
    <div class="verse">And wondered how long it would be ere this strong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Handsome stranger acknowledged defeat.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">But strangest to tell, it was Doug and not Nell</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who emerged from that contest the victor.</div>
    <div class="verse">It was nothing he did, but a loneliness hid</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In her bosom that finally tricked her.</div>
    <div class="verse">For Doug spoke of the night, and the glorious flight</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of ships through the reaches of Space;</div>
    <div class="verse">Of his hopes and his schemes&mdash;and his words wakened dreams</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That softened the lines of Nell's face.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">He was just on the verge of confessing the urge</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That brought him back out of the void</div>
    <div class="verse">When a servant discreet appeared in their retreat</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And Nell faced the fellow, annoyed.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Well?" she icily said. The man bobbed his head.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"A visiphone call on the rack."</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell sighed as she rose. "Some friend, I suppose.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Wait, Dougal; I'll hurry right back."</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">An expression surprisingly soft in her eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She answered the visiphone.</div>
    <div class="verse">Her caller, however (the cradle-monk), never</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Detected her altered tone.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Hey, Nell, there's a chump on his way to your dump,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A big, quiet sort of a lout</div>
    <div class="verse">By name of MacNeer&mdash;" Nell told him, "He's here;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">What's all the commotion about?"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">A hungry grimace of greed mottled the face of</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The vengeful space-harbor assistant.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Do I get my percent for a tip on the gent?"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He parried in accents insistent.</div>
    <div class="verse">"You mean&mdash;?" whispered Nell. And, "Surer than hell!"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The answer came back, swift and eager,</div>
    <div class="verse">"I've just seen his log, and he's in from the Bog</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With a claim-stake the size of Omega!"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Now, for those who don't know their A. L. &amp; O.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The "Bog" is a treacherous sector</div>
    <div class="verse">Of planetoids legion, a tightly-packed region</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Avoided by every prospector.</div>
    <div class="verse">None but the most daring do any space-faring</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In those lethal, whirlagig niches,</div>
    <div class="verse">But spacemen all claim that the Bog is aflame</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With infinite, fabulous riches.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'Twas thence that the crew of the L-32</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Returned with a cargo of ore</div>
    <div class="verse">That assayed ninety-one and a half to the ton</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;Or maybe a little bit more.</div>
    <div class="verse">It was out of the Bog that old space-weasel Scrogg</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Withdrew on his gravity-tractor</div>
    <div class="verse">The rock 4-Omega, which brought such a figure</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Scrogg set himself up as a Factor.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">So it's easily seen why Nell's new, serene</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Complaisance should disappear rudely.</div>
    <div class="verse">She gasped and she started; her crimson lips parted;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her eyes narrowed sharply and shrewdly.</div>
    <div class="verse">"You're positive?" Slyly responded the spy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"Why else would he put into Krull</div>
    <div class="verse">With motors O.Q., and flame-jets brand-new,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And fuel-chambers more than half-full?"</div>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">IV</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Now, though Nelly was young, as has often been sung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her chosen profession was old.</div>
    <div class="verse">Both instinct and habit advised her to "<i>Grab it!</i>"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whenever she heard the word "gold."</div>
    <div class="verse">She broke the connection, her vivid complexion</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">More flushed, and with movements exotic</div>
    <div class="verse">Returned to the glade in which Dougal had stayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her inner emotions chaotic.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">She studied MacNeer as she slowly drew near,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Appraising him in a new light.</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell trusted her spy; he would not tell a lie&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But somehow it didn't seem right!</div>
    <div class="verse">MacNeer didn't act like a man who had cracked</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A cache of asteroid dough,</div>
    <div class="verse">And yet&mdash;Venus Nell smiled tightly&mdash;Ah, well,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She'd know in a minute or so.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">With a cute little shrug she curled on the rug</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And smiled into Doug's sober face.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Go on!" she implored, "and tell me some more</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">About your adventures in Space.</div>
    <div class="verse">Have you ever struck gold in the terrible cold?"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her voice was a query and taunt.</div>
    <div class="verse">Doug grinned at her there as he fondled her hair.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"I've found all the gold that <i>I</i> want!"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Nell's eyes opened wide. "You have?" she replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And suddenly somewhere within her</div>
    <div class="verse">A duel transpired 'tween the Nell who admired</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">This miner and Nelly the sinner.</div>
    <div class="verse">Which would have won out is a matter of doubt</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But Dougal MacNeer, growing bolder,</div>
    <div class="verse">At that moment tossed dice with Fate&mdash;and he lost!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;By placing a hand on her shoulder.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">He bent to her ear, and, "Nelly, my dear,"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He whispered, "Come lift gravs with me</div>
    <div class="verse">To the skyways above ... I'll teach you to love ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">How wonderfully happy we'll be...."</div>
    <div class="verse">And&mdash;that was a story to Nell old and hoary;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nell shrugged with a gesture resigned;</div>
    <div class="verse">A lustful and bestial man, just like the rest</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of his sex....</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">And she made up her mind.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Averting her face, she escaped his embrace</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And whispered, "Wait here for a minute&mdash;"</div>
    <div class="verse">A prearranged sign brought a fresh jug of wine</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To Doug&mdash;with a sleeping drug in it.</div>
    <div class="verse">Dougal, gleaming of eye, the glass lifted high</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And drank it down, swiftly and deep;</div>
    <div class="verse">In no time at all, he lay there asprawl</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In impotent, stertorous sleep.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">A pungent aroma jarred Doug from his coma</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Much later. He lifted his head</div>
    <div class="verse">To find he was not in the cool, shady grot</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But in some sort of workshop, instead.</div>
    <div class="verse">His senses were blurry, his tongue thick and furry;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He gagged at the odor and choked.</div>
    <div class="verse">Then, head still awhirl, he noticed the girl,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And, "Nelly, where are we?" he croaked.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">But the girl standing there with the bright yaller hair</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was hardly the girl of his dreams.</div>
    <div class="verse">She was distant and cold, her manner was bold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her eyes glistened brightly with schemes.</div>
    <div class="verse">With icy <i>élan</i> she spoke to the man</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At Dougal's side, "Very well, Gurk,</div>
    <div class="verse">He's come to his senses, let's drop the pretenses;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Its time we got down to our work."</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"Work, Nell?" Dougal gasped, and confusedly clasped</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His hammering head in his hands.</div>
    <div class="verse">He learned, then, that he was bound, foot and knee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To his seat by unbreakable bands.</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell said with a numb, deadly smile, "Don't play dumb!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Be smart and you'll shorten this visit.</div>
    <div class="verse">We know from your log you struck gold in the Bog;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now, come clean and tell us&mdash;where is it?"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"G-gold?" gulped MacNeer. "Th-there's some mistake here!"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He grinned, "Aw, you're kidding me, honey!</div>
    <div class="verse">Now, be a good sport&mdash;" The girl cut him short,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"I don't think this matter is funny!</div>
    <div class="verse">I gave you a chance to go into your dance;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If you won't, why&mdash;" She shifted her eyes</div>
    <div class="verse">To her white-coated aide. "Well, Gurk, I'm afraid</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He must talk through the <i>menavise</i>."</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">As Doug MacNeer's eyes opened wide in surprise</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Gurk drew from a nearby cask</div>
    <div class="verse">A shimmering, fiery helmet of wire;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A sinister sort of mask.</div>
    <div class="verse">Doug never had seen the fantastic machine</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Before, but he'd oftentimes heard</div>
    <div class="verse">Of the dreaded and hated device that translated</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Men's thoughts into spoken words!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">With a terrible cry of anger, on high</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He lifted his brawny fists,</div>
    <div class="verse">But an instrument clicked, and manacles snicked!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Like vises about his wrists.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Well, <i>now</i> will you tell us?" persisted Nell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"There's nothing to tell!" he said.</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell's warm lips drew fine, and she made a brief sign ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the helmet dropped over his head!</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">It was Nell who depressed the stud that expressed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In flaming, electric flood</div>
    <div class="verse">The current that boils its way through the coils</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of a menavisal hood.</div>
    <div class="verse">There was silence at first, then the silence burst</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In a moment of horror fraught,</div>
    <div class="verse">As Doug MacNeer's voice babbled clear</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In fragments of tortured thought.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"<i>I don't understand ... I can't move a hand ...</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>head aches, and my brain is on fire....</i></div>
    <div class="verse"><i>Stars ... Nelly ... Oh, Lord!</i>" Thus Dougal's thoughts poured</div>
    <div class="verse">In words through the webwork of wire.</div>
    <div class="verse">"<i>Must be a mistake ... I can't be awake</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The orbit of Ceres is reckoned</i></div>
    <div class="verse">"<i>At three-oh-oh-ten....</i>" Nell stepped forward then.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"O.Q., Gurk&mdash;let up for a second!"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">The shimmering died, and to Dougal she cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"MacNeer, all we want to know</div>
    <div class="verse">Is: <i>Where is the gold?</i> As soon as you've told</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">We promise to let you go."</div>
    <div class="verse">"I've told you already," gasped Doug, unsteady,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"You're wrong if you think I'm rich&mdash;"</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell's scarlet mouth curled. "Fool! Liar!" she snarled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She viciously closed the switch.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Once again sallow flame trembled hot through the frame</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the <i>menavise</i>; once again</div>
    <div class="verse">Electrical stresses probed deep the recesses</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of Dougal's tormented brain.</div>
    <div class="verse">"<i>The torments of hell&mdash;but I never can tell ...</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>A man must fight to the end ...</i></div>
    <div class="verse"><i>My eyes&mdash;I've gone blind ... my head ... and my mind ...</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>If I only ... could only ... bend....</i>"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">It is better to not reveal just what</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Things Dougal said and did</div>
    <div class="verse">In the hour or more that followed, for</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Such secrets are better hid.</div>
    <div class="verse">He babbled of dreams, and hopes and schemes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And names long lost in the past;</div>
    <div class="verse">He spoke of flight through the endless night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And of cosmic reaches vast.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">But never he told of wealth or gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Though now he was growing weak;</div>
    <div class="verse">Till finally the girl turned to her churl</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Lips set, and as marble bleak.</div>
    <div class="verse">"He's stalled long enough!" she rasped. "He's tough,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he's held out for more than an hour;</div>
    <div class="verse">But I'm going to get that secret yet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If I have to turn on full power!"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Gurk shook his head, and warningly said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"I wouldn't attempt it, Nell!</div>
    <div class="verse">'Twould be of no use, an ounce more juice</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Would blister his mind to hell.</div>
    <div class="verse">He's weak as a cat; if you try that&mdash;"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He frowned&mdash;"After all that he's had,</div>
    <div class="verse">Another degree of power would be</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sufficient to drive him mad!"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"That's up to him!" cried Nell, and grim</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of eye she approached the side</div>
    <div class="verse">Of Doug MacNeer, and, "Listen here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You obstinate fool!" she cried,</div>
    <div class="verse">As she pressed the key to the last degree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"You know very well you told</div>
    <div class="verse">Me you'd found all the gold that a man could want</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;Now, answer: <i>Where is that gold?</i>"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">The <i>menavise</i> flamed, the battered and maimed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hulk standing before them jerked</div>
    <div class="verse">As the blistering pain seared Dougal's brain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">MacNeer's lips horribly worked....</div>
    <div class="verse">And across the tomblike expanse of the room</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His feeble answer carried:</div>
    <div class="verse">"... <i>lonely as hell ... must ask sweet Nell ...</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>It's time I was getting married....</i>"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"<i>I think that she ... and I could be ...</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>So happy ... a golden prize....</i></div>
    <div class="verse"><i>But ... Oh, the pain!</i>" And he screamed again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The light died out of his eyes.</div>
    <div class="verse">And Nell stood aghast, to have seen at last</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The terrible answer bare:</div>
    <div class="verse">The gold of his dream was the glorious stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of her own bright yaller hair!</div>
